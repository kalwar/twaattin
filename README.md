# Twaattin

Twaattin is a Twitter client meant to showcase [Vaadin](https://vaadin.com) features step-by-step in the context of [Learning Vaadin 7](http://www.packtpub.com/learning-vaadin-7-second-edition/book).

* [Chapter 4](https://github.com/nfrankel/twaattin/tree/chapter4) describes components. Twattin starts in this chapter by setting basic component classes for the application.
* [Chapter 5](https://github.com/nfrankel/twaattin/tree/chapter5) is about the event-listener model. At this point, Twaattin is updated to add behavior triggered by user actions, in particular a login feature.
* [Chapter 6](https://github.com/nfrankel/twaattin/tree/chapter6) describes Table components. At this step, Twaattin displays tweets of the logged-in user in such a component.
* [Chapter 7](https://github.com/nfrankel/twaattin/tree/chapter7) goes through Vaadin advanced features, and more specifically Server Push. Now, Twattin is enhanced with this push ability, so that newer tweets are automatically displayed with no user interaction.
* [Chapter 9](https://github.com/nfrankel/twaattin/tree/chapter9) tells about custom component building. Twaattin tweet-displaying table is replaced by a tweet-displaying component.
